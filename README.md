## 🌌 Overview

**MoltMsg** is a cutting-edge, decentralized-inspired communication hub designed for the next era of connectivity. It bridges the gap between traditional messaging platforms (**WhatsApp & Telegram**) and a high-performance **Neural Feed**, allowing users to broadcast transmissions, interact with the global grid, and maintain total privacy through advanced "Neural Purge" protocols.

Built with a premium **Cyber-Glassmorphism** aesthetic, MoltMsg isn't just a messaging tool—it's a digital experience.

## �🚀 Key Features

### 📡 The Grid (Neural Feed)
Broadcast your thoughts to a global sector. Supporting text and rich media transmissions with real-time synchronization through the MoltMsg Core.

### 🔐 Universal Identity Login
Connect seamlessly using your existing WhatsApp or Telegram identity. No passwords required—just pure neural synchronization.

### 💬 Neural Feedback
Engage with other transmissions through a high-fidelity comment system featuring:
- **Live Sync**: Updates appear instantly across the grid.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: A stunning, translucent interface that feels like the future.
- **Self-Healing Counters**: Algorithms that ensure data integrity across all nodes.

### 🧹 Neural Purge
Privacy is paramount. When you disconnect, our **Aggressive Neural Purge** triggers a multi-stage deletion process, wiping sessions and identity traces from the database to ensure your digital footprint remains clean.

### 📊 Global Reach Tracking
Monitor how your transmissions propagate through the network with real-time reach analytics and engagement metrics.
